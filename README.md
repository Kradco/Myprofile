<h1>My Profile</h1>
<img src="mypic.jpg"alt="mypicture"width="500" height="333">
<p>My name is Alan, and I live in Wollongong, NSW, which is around a 1.5-hour drive from Sydney.India is my country of origin. I was born and raised in that country for 15 years before moving to Australia in 2015. Snowboarding is one of my favorite hobbies. Every year, I would go to the snow since it is something I look forwards to. Because of covid, I believe there wasn't much this and last year. Gaming is one of other my pastimes, and I have two cats named Suchu and Snow.</p>

<p>The technology around me, such as smartphones and PCs, piqued my interest in IT. I've always loved computers and built my first gaming computer in eighth grade because I'm a gamer. The RMIT seemed like a good option because it's known for IT courses and practical learning, even though it's entirely online. I am now pursuing a bachelor's degree in information technology to immerse myself in fundamental and advanced IT knowledge that will aid me in my future IT career choices. .</p>

<p>Using personality features to form workgroups and teams can be extremely beneficial in the long term. It is impossible to overestimate the value of diversity in a group setting.It can help the strengths and weaknesses in certain areas and with the combined effort of the team, we can overcome them.
It can assist in identifying strengths and weaknesses in specific areas, and with the team's joint work, we can overcome them.</p>

<p>The difference between these two professions is that a Network Administrator is in charge of the network (a collection of computers networked together), whereas a System Administrator is in charge of the computer systems - all of the components that make a computer work.</p>

<p>Within the IT department, both systems administrators and network administrators play critical roles. While some smaller businesses combine the duties of both professions into one post, major computing systems frequently require specialist support for each form of IT management. Both system administrator and network administrator professions can be rewarding career paths for someone like me who is interested in IT management.</p>

<h3>Project Idea</h3>

<h4>Overview</h4>

<p>The project idea will be a color blindness application that will help to increase accessibility and usability across multiple digital devices. The issues with color blindness and how we deal with them, as well as whether or not there is a better way to identify colors. The present state of color blindness and how it affects people. To do so, you'll need to understand color blindness and how to apply it to the application, as well as the tools and technologies required for the process.</p>
<h4>Motivation</h4>
<p>Color blindness can take numerous forms, but it always boils down to not seeing color properly, mixing colors, or being unable to distinguish between certain colors.</p>
<p>The environments in which people use their devices might potentially increase difficulties. Low-quality displays, poor lighting, screen glare, small mobile screens, and sitting too far away from a large television screen are all examples of this.</p>
<p>Websites and other applications that rely solely on color for readability and affordance become difficult to use, harming readership and sales for businesses as well as people's daily lives.There are an estimated 300 million colorblind people on the planet. Color blindness is more widespread than you may believe! Color blindness affects one in every 12 men, but only one in every 200 women. This suggests that men account for 95% of the colorblind population. Red-green color blindness affects 98 percent of people with color blindness.</p>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>An application that converts computer display colors into distinguishable colors for a variety of people, including those with color vision deficit, sometimes known as color blindness. </p>
<p>The features that can be included are as follows:</p>
<h5>Readability of the text</h5>
<p>To ensure that text is readable, it should meet accessibility guidelines based on the combination of text color, background color, and text size. </p>
<h5>Overlapping Text On Background Images</h5>
<p>Words layered on graphics can be problematic since some or all of the images may lack enough contrast for the text to stand out. The contrast is increased by lowering the backdrop opacity, making the text easier to read.</p>
<h5>Color Combinations</h5>

 <img src="trac.jpg"alt="traffic light" align="left"width="400" height="200">

<p>If at all possible, avoid the following color combinations:</p>
<ul>
<li>green/red</li>
<li>green/brown</li>
<li>blue/purple</li>
<li>green/blue</li>
<li>light green/yellow</li>
<li>blue/grey</li>
<li>green/grey</li>
<li>green/black</li>
</ul>
 
<h5>Identifying colors with textual support </h5>
<p>If the colors green and red are present in the image, being able to identify color with the text of a small size</p>
<h5>Saturation increase </h5>
<p>The saturation of all hues is increased when the saturation is increased.</p>
<h5>Filtering</h5>
<p>Filtering darkens all colors except the one you specify.</p>
<h4>Tools and Technologies</h4>
<p>This software can be written in a variety of languages, including JavaScript, C++, Python, and others. Python is a dynamically semantic, interpreted, object-oriented high-level programming language that was chosen. Because of its high-level built-in data structures, dynamic typing, and dynamic binding, it's perfect for Rapid Application Development and as a scripting or glue language for integrating existing components.</p>
<p>Minimum hardware requirements for python programming</p>

<ul>
<li>Processors: Intel Atom® processor or Intel® Core™ i3 processor</li>
<li>Disk space: 1 GB</li>
<li>Operating systems: Windows* 7 or later, macOS, and Linux</li>
<li>Python* versions: 2.7.X, 3.6.X</li>
</ul>
<p>Tkinter is a graphical user interface (GUI) library. It's a very basic library, and figuring out how to use it quickly is simple. Tkinter has the advantage of not requiring any additional setup. That will suffice if you have Python IDLE installed on your computer. Tkinter is included with the Python IDLE. There are alternative frameworks PyQT, WxPython, PyGUI, PySimpleGUI, Kivy but the Tkinter is more beginner-friendly</p>

<h6>Skills required </h6>
<p>To create a desktop app in Python, you must first understand the basics of the language</p>
<p>Basic programming skills</p>
<ul>
<li>The XY Problem</li>
<li>Understanding why the code works (or doesn’t)</li>
<li>Working with strings</li>
<li>Working with lists</li>
<li>Using loops</li>
<li>Using functions (and talking about them correctly).</li>
<li>Object-Oriented Programming</li>
<li>Respect PEP</li>
</ul>
<p>Desktop apps work mostly based on objects, and hence, you need to know the object-oriented concepts in Python to create apps. The required understanding of what classes, objects, methods, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and other terms mean and how they are used.</p>
<p>With the help of the internet, learning, and understanding anything has never been easier. Search engines, videos, and even the community can be used to learn new skills. The majority of abilities are learned through trial and error and a hands-on approach. With the prevalence of technology in the twenty-first century, getting software and hardware isn't much of a problem.</p>
<h4>Outcome </h4>
<p>Color-blind people will be able to recognize colors with ease if the application is successful. color combinations should also be taken into account while creating the application. Hence the Color-blind users will benefit greatly by being able to see colored graphics and images with the help of textual support. . When it comes to hues like green and red, it might be challenging because they are commonly utilized for a variety of purposes. As a result, people with this disability can feel more productive at work or with anything that has to do with colors.</p>
